<p>Hello! This is Nicole Cai. </p>
<p>I am a PhD student from Virginia Institute of Marine Science.</p>
<p>I'm currently studying the impacts of vegetation, including submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and tidal marshes, on water quality at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Other aspects of my work focus on model developments. I am building a new comprehensive water quality model using high-resolution unstructured grids, and developing a coupled vegetation model linked to the water quality model. The dissertation research is funded by California Department of Water Resources for the management implications on SAV controlling targets in the Bay-Delta system. </p>
