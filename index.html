<p>Hello</p>
<p>This is Nicole Cai. </p>
<p>I am a PhD student from Virginia Institute of Marine Science.</p>
<p>The topic of my thesis is "A Numerical Modeling Study of the Impact of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation on Water Quality in San Francisco Bay-Delta". The overall objective of this study is to determine the impact of SAV on water quality in San Francisco Bay-Delta. This study is motivated by the important role of SAV in the physical and ecological environments, especially by the issue of invasive species in San Francisco Bay Delta. As management practice can also produce large biomass changes over shorter time scales, causing huge change in the whole ecosystem, the predictions of SAV impact is further essential. SCHISM-ICM, a three-dimentional hydrodynamic-eutrophication model, will be imbedded with SAV sub-model for our study.</p>
