# Coastal Processes in a Changing Environment
<br/>

## Course description
This course explores the physical, biological, ecological, and geomorphic processes that shape coastal environments and how these processes respond to natural variability and human driven changes. Topics include tides, waves, saltwater intrusion, estuarine circulation, nutrient dynamics, sediment transport, and the evolution of coastal shoreline. Students work with analytical and numerical models, interpret field observations, and analyze real world case studies related to coastal resilience and adaptation.
<br/>

## Learning goals
- Explain the physical mechanisms governing tides, waves, estuarine circulation, and coastal stratification.
- Describe how saltwater intrusion, freshwater input, and density gradients influence coastal hydrodynamics.
- Interpret how biogeochemical processes including nutrient cycling, primary production, oxygen dynamics, and carbon transformations interact with physical drivers.
- Analyze sediment transport processes and resulting shoreline and marsh morphology.
- Analyze how physical and biogeochemical processes together shape wetland stability and coastal ecosystem function.
- Evaluate coastal vulnerability through modeling exercises, observational datasets, and case studies.
- Communicate scientific interpretations relevant to coastal management and climate adaptation.
