## Teaching Philosophy
As an educator, my central goal is to inspire students to explore Earth system science and equip them with the skills to think critically, analyze complex systems, and collaborate across disciplines. I believe that effective teaching is rooted in three interconnected pillars: clarity, engagement, and adaptability. Through transparent expectations, active learning strategies, and personalized feedback, I aim to create a learning environment where students from diverse backgrounds feel supported and challenged; and where they are empowered to engage constructively with different people, spaces, situations, and ideas.

I design courses with clearly defined learning objectives and scaffolded content that fosters both individual growth and peer learning. My teaching integrates lectures, visual media, interactive simulations, small-group discussions, and open-ended problem-solving exercises. I adopt a Q&A-driven approach—starting with observations, posing “why” questions, and guiding students toward scientific reasoning. This method encourages students to build knowledge actively and collaboratively, rather than passively receiving information.

To ensure accessibility and inclusion, especially in interdisciplinary or mixed-preparation classrooms, I use a “teaching from scratch” approach. I offer pre-class materials, recorded content for flexible review, and low-stakes assessments to reinforce understanding. In advanced courses, I emphasize project-based learning and open-ended research assignments that allow students to connect course topics to their own interests and lived experiences. These strategies help build a shared foundation while allowing each student to navigate the material in a way that feels authentic and meaningful.

My teaching also centers on preparing students to work across disciplinary boundaries and with diverse communities. Earth and environmental sciences demand systems-level thinking, cross-cultural communication, and ethical engagement with societal challenges. Whether students are modeling saltwater intrusion, examining nutrient cycles, or assessing coastal resilience, I encourage them to situate their work within broader ecological, social, and policy contexts. In doing so, I hope to cultivate scientists and citizens who can engage with complexity and uncertainty; and who are equipped to collaborate across worldviews and disciplines.
